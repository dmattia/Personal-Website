# Personal-Website

This is my personal website.  It was built with Bootstrap and includes quite a few outside js libraries, but a large amount of html and css is my own creation.  The website is never really "complete" as I update it all the time, so don't think too much of it if you notice a few features that seem to be only part way implemented. They will all get done in time :)
