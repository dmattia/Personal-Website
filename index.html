When I was a freshman in high school, I was introduced to programming on a TI-84 calculator.  I made hundreds of programs for my math classes, and realized I really enjoyed coding.  I began teaching myself multiple other languages and learning as much as I could about computer hardware and software.  I have a wide range of interests, but am specifically looking to combine my loves of computer engineering, medicine, and business after graduation.  I am currently searching for an internship for the Summer of 2015.</p>

                <p class="small-text wow animated fadeInRight">As a goal-oriented person, I find great satisfaction in helping one of my teams achieve an objective. I do this by jumping at opportunity, such as when I heard about blood drives.  I had never given or even been to a drive before, but saw potential to help others when the Red Cross' blood reserves were low. I gathered as many of my friends as I could and organized an event.  After great success, I decided to continue hosting drives and still love doing so to this day.</p>

               	<p class="small-text wow animated fadeInRight">I am blessed with opportunity at Notre Dame, and am trying to make the most out of it.  I belong to the large community of Notre Dame, but also to smaller groups such as being a member of Stanford Hall, the Computer Science and Engineering Department, the American Red Cross Club, the Bengal Bouts Boxing Program, the 1 E/W football team, and many others. In each group, I strive to build up those around me.  I have always been taught that a true leader does not need a leadership position, but can strengthen a system from anywhere in an organization. I look to be a good member by personally working as hard as I can, encouraging others, asking questions when I am not sure the best way forward, and maintaining a positive attitude.</p>

                        The Bengal Bouts Boxing Program is a five month journey for two hours per day. In addition to attending at least 80% of practices, all boxers must raise $500 for the Holy Cross Mission in Bangladesh in order to be eligible for the tournament.  Through this common goal, I was able to find a strong sense of camaraderie with my teammates despite the fact that I may have to face them in the ring.

I hosted three drives this past Summer, and am planning to eventually host every two months.  As the host, I am responsible for finding a date and location, recruiting donors and volunteers for the drive, and overseeing the drive on the day of.

I hope to help Addison and the Muscular Dystrophy Association for as long as I can.

There is no lying to a bar: you either get the lift or you haven't put in enough work yet.  The combination of mental toughness, heart, skill, and strength necessary to succeed means every day is a challenge. And one I look forward to accepting.

                        Web design allows me to showcase two of my greatest passions: coding and graphic design.  It has allowed me to meet and work with local business owners and collaborate on design schemes until I could make them a website they would be proud to use.  Although I am not interested in doing web design as a career, I will continue to design sites as a hobby.

                        <div class="tn3 description">
                        I spent the second semester my freshman year working with Professors Bowyer and Flynn on their iris aging research.  They focus on biometrics and how face recognition software needs to adapt to iris changes over time.  My job was researching a new paper that suggested that the iris may not age at all, as well as other recent advancements from sources around the world.

                        As a part of my Intro to Engineering course, I was asked to create a fairly open project of my own choosing using MATLAB.  I ended up creating three Sudoku algorithms to test against each other.  I also needed to make an algorithm to create puzzles with only one solution and a GUI (shown above) that allowed the user to easily view my results.

In addition to attending at least 80% of practices, all boxers must raise $500 for the Holy Cross Mission in Bangladesh in order to be eligible for the tournament.  Through this common goal, I was able to find a strong sense of camaraderie with my teammates despite the fact that I may have to face them in the ring.

Addison is not just the camper I take care of, but one of my best friends. He is physically disabled, but is an incredibly kind and smart teenager with full mental capabilities.  I hope to help Addison and the Muscular Dystrophy Association for as long as I can.

                         My high school became the first in Minnesota to ever host a FMSC Mobile Pack event my Junior Year.  It took $15,000 of fundraising to have the event, so that was our major obstacle.  I helped fundraise by emceeing a fashion show, and also helped out with recruitment and day of activities.  It proved a great success, and we were even more successful with a $24,000 event my senior year.
